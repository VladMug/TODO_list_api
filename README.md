# TODO-list-api
## Simple TODO List API in Python
### Description
This is my first attempt to build a simple Python API as a learning project.  
It implements basic CRUD operations for managing TODO notes.

### Instuctions:
1. Clone repository 
2. Install requirements from requirements.txt
3. Run the API: like
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
4. (Optional) You can test the CRUD operations in main.py by uncommenting them at the end of the file.
  

## Status
The project works, but it's not finished yet â€” there's still room for improvement.
### TODO:
  * Create tests(pytest)
  * Integrate Docker and Docker Compose  
  * Create a simple interface (Telegram bot or HTML web page)
